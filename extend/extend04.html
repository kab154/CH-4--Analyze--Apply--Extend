                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to compare and contrast your findings regarding hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL color codes. -->
                <p><h3>Hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL color codes format:</h3></p>
                <p> 
                    When it comes to creating color  there are 3 different ways to create them that can be used. Color can be created by using hex, rgb, hsl which are all ways to create more visually pleasing website.
                    that can change font and background colors. The difference between is how precise you want to be. Hex is easier way to create color, using six hexadecimals numbers you can create any color but can 
                    be more restricted. Using RGB which represent Red, Green, Blue you can be more precise in making color and can even design your own. Hsl is a combination of both using a straighforward interpretation.
                    Using hsl you can customize your own color and easier to use.
                </p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify your preferred color code format (hexadecimal, RBG, or HSL) and why. -->
                <p><h3>Preferred color code format: </h3> </p>

                <P>Picking color code format is all about how much you want to design your own website. I preferred to use hsl because having the option to be more precise in what color i want to use and being easy to understand is a bonus in using HSL.</P>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss HWB color. -->
                <p><h3>HWB summary</h3></p>
                <p>
                    HSW stand for hue, whitness and blackness. H(Hue) has a range of 0 - 360 and W(whitness) and B(Blackness) obviosly control how white or black the hue is which maxes out to 100%
                </p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss CMYK color. -->
                <p><h3>CMYK summary</h3></p>
                <p>
                    CMYK is really easy to undrestang they just stand for cyan,magenta,yellow and key which help to achieves the color your looking for.
